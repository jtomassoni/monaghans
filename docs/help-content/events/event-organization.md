# Organizing Events with Venue Areas and Tags

Make events easier to find, filter, and manage.

## Venue Areas

Specify where event takes place.

### Set Venue Area

When creating or editing event:

1. Find **"Venue Area"** field
2. Enter location (e.g., "Main Bar", "Patio", "Stage")
3. Save

### Benefits

- Customers know where to find event
- Filter events by location
- See which areas are used when

### Common Venue Areas

Examples:
- Main Bar
- Patio
- Stage
- Private Room
- Outdoor Area
- Game Room

## Tags

Keywords that categorize and organize events.

### Add Tags

When creating or editing event:

1. Find **"Tags"** field
2. Enter tags separated by commas (e.g., "music, live, entertainment")
3. Or select from existing tags
4. Save

### Best Practices

- Be consistent: Use same tags for similar events
- Keep it simple: 2-4 tags per event
- Use common terms: Tags customers might search

### Common Tags

Examples:
- **Type**: music, sports, trivia, karaoke, comedy
- **Audience**: all-ages, 21+, family-friendly
- **Style**: live, DJ, acoustic, cover-band
- **Frequency**: weekly, monthly, special

## Using Together

Combine tags and venue areas:

**Example Event**:
- **Title**: "Acoustic Night"
- **Venue Area**: "Patio"
- **Tags**: "music, acoustic, weekly"

Tells you:
- Music event (tag)
- Acoustic style (tag)
- Weekly (tag)
- On patio (venue area)

## Filtering

In events list view, filter by:
- **Tags**: Show only events with specific tags
- **Venue Area**: Show only events in specific locations
- **Combined**: Use both filters together

## Benefits

Well-organized events help:
- **Finding**: Quickly locate specific types
- **Planning**: See what's happening in each area
- **Marketing**: Group similar events for promotions
- **Reporting**: Analyze popular event types

## Tips

- Standardize: Create list of standard venue areas and tags
- Review regularly: Clean up unused tags
- Customer-focused: Use tags customers would search
- Be specific: "Live Music" better than "Music"
