# Reordering Menu Sections and Items

Reorder sections and items using simple drag-and-drop. No numbers or manual ordering needed.

## How It Works

Both sections and items use **drag-and-drop** reordering:
- Click and hold an item or section
- Drag it to the desired position
- Release to save the new order
- Changes save automatically

## Reorder Sections

Reorder menu sections (Appetizers, Entrees, Desserts, etc.):

1. Go to [Menu](/admin/menu)
2. Click the **"Reorder Sections"** toggle at the top
3. Drag sections up or down to reorder
4. Release to save
5. Click **"Reorder Sections"** again to exit reorder mode

### Visual Feedback

While reordering:
- Dragged section appears slightly transparent
- Drop target shows a blue highlight
- Order updates in real-time as you drag

## Reorder Items

Reorder items within a section:

1. Go to [Menu](/admin/menu)
2. Expand the section containing items you want to reorder
3. Click the **"Reorder Items"** toggle for that section
4. Drag items up or down within the section
5. Release to save
6. Click **"Reorder Items"** again to exit reorder mode

### Important Notes

- Items can only be reordered within their own section
- To move an item to a different section, edit the item and change its section
- Each section has its own reorder mode toggle

## Tips

### Plan Your Order

Think about logical flow:
- **Sections**: Appetizers → Main Courses → Desserts → Drinks
- **Items**: Popular items first, or group by type

### Quick Reordering

- Drag items to the top to make them appear first
- Drag items to the bottom to make them appear last
- Reorder multiple items in one session

### Visual Organization

- Keep related items together
- Group similar items (e.g., all burgers together)
- Place popular or featured items at the top

## Ordering Strategies

### By Popularity
Drag most popular items to the top of each section.

### Alphabetical
Arrange items A-Z within each section.

### By Price
Group items by price range (lowest to highest, or vice versa).

### By Category
Group similar items together (e.g., all burgers, then all sandwiches).

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Drag Items
- Make sure **"Reorder Items"** toggle is enabled for that section
- Ensure the section is expanded
- Try refreshing the page

### Can't Drag Sections
- Make sure **"Reorder Sections"** toggle is enabled at the top
- Try refreshing the page

### Changes Not Saving
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Changes should save automatically when you release the drag
